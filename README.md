# DSN Explorer 10
Inspired by Windows MSN Messenger 7 and MSN Explorer 7 / 10, originally from kamuisuki's [**Discord MSN EXPLORER 10**](https://www.deviantart.com/kamuisuki/art/Discord-MSN-Explorer-10-theme-873282935) theme.

Back from hiatus!! Update coming soon~

also warning: due to how small the main font is, it can often be blurry and illegible. if its too much to handle i'd suggest switching --font-small from MS Sans Serif to Tahoma.

P.S. this theme is very ugly at the moment!!! anything may be suited to be changed! I've only been doing CSS for a year and as I improve, so will the theme!
P.P.S. due to the way discord handles icons, 99% of the custom icons from this theme won't work with languages other than english. sorry!!! ☹️
