# Discord Live Messenger
Inspired by Windows' MSN Messengers' 7th major version, originally from kamuisuki's [**Discord MSN EXPLORER 10**](https://www.deviantart.com/kamuisuki/art/Discord-MSN-Explorer-10-theme-873282935) theme.

## Sources

None of this could've been done without the people who made the works below. I owe you people the world and I'm glad there are people who still enjoy the Windows XP visual style.

## Roadmap

Very soon:
- Finish adding all icons
- Moving to Sass
- Settings menu
- Context windows

Later:
- User profiles
- Scroll bars
- Log in menu

Then finally:
- MSN emojis
- Dark mode support
- User customization

Then it'll finally be ready for BetterDiscord Themes!
